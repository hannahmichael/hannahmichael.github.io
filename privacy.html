It is also possible that permissions have been allowed for the data to be used by third parties. <br> A presence created online about a person without their knowledge could impact their privacy. If you are sharing your own information you are aware of what has been shared, but what about your child? A parent is incharge of the online privacy of their children, but what happens when the children begin to use social media themselves. <br> Sharing about your children online is completely okay as long as you are aware of general security issues, practice good security. This should also be encouraged for children to do the same.</p>
